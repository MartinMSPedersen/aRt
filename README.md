# 12 Months of aRt

This is the repository for my 12 Months of aRt project. Each month of 2019 I tackle a new generative/data art project. All of this work is done with R. Read more about it in my <a href="https://www.williamrchase.com/post/12-months-of-art/" target="_blank">project intro blog post</a>. There is a folder for each month that contains all of the code and art along with a readme to explain how to use the scripts. Each month also has an accompanying blog post which you can find below that explains the process and shows off many of the art pieces.
