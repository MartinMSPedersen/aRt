# How to make

The best place to start is the blog post which contains some explanation of the various functions and strategies I developed for this project. This repository contains three scripts that roughly group some projects. The first is `poisson_animation.R` which contains scripts to make animated color gradients like "sunrise.gif" and "waterfall.gif" that are found in the `outputs` folder. The second is `triangles.R` which contains the code to make the "textured_triangles.png" sketches. Finally, `pebbles.R` contains many functions and examples of how to make several types of sketches with rounded voronoi polygons that resemble pebbles, these include "gradient_rocks.png", "calder_pebbles.png", and 
"textured_pebbles.png" in the `outputs` folder. Many of the functions here should be reusable and you can mix and match and hopefully come up with something all your own. There's also lots of parameters that you can tweak, which I tried to document somewhat in the code comments, but if anything is not clear, please get in touch. Best of luck!
